##Introduction
The introduction (required) shall consist of a brief paragraph or two that summarizes the purpose and function of this project.

##Requirements
The idea is to inform the users about what is required, so that everything they need can be procured and included in advance of attempting to install the module. If there are no requirements, write "No special requirements".

##Installation
The installation section (required*) shall make it clear how to install the module.

##Configuration
The configuration section (required) is necessary even when little configuration is required. Use this section to list special notes about the configuration of this module â€“ including but not limited to permissions.

##Troubleshooting & FAQ
These sections are optional. If present, they should address questions that are asked frequently in the issue queue (this will save you time in the future).
